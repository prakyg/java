/* 
* Input format:
* The first line contains tc, the number of test cases.
* The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.
* 
* Output format:
* You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in Jhool's browser, to your normal browser.
* 
* Constraints:
* 1 <= tc <= 100
* 1 <= Length of the website <= 200
* 
* NOTE: You do NOT need to print the output in its lowest format. You should print in its original fraction format.
* The names of all the websites will be in small case only.
* 
* Every string will start from www. and end with .com, so well!
* Sample Input
* 
* 2
* www.google.com
* www.hackerearth.com
* 
* Sample Output
* 
* 7/14
* 11/19
